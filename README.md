# zOS-Utilities

This is a library of some commonly used mainframe utilities running on IBM's z/OS.

## Usage

Job cards were intentionally omitted, as well as the dataset names and high level qualifiers, as these are shop-specific.

There may be comments in the body of the module itself so be sure to refer to them too.
